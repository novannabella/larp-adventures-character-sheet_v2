Schematic Encryption,"[Runes] You may disguise the meaning of your Artificer Schematics, so other fellow Artificers cannot read it to learn its secrets.

The Professional expertise required to bypass your encryption for this Schematic is your Artificer Professional Expertise Tier when the Schematic was created.",Artificer,1,,"Characters with Appraise [Runes] may, once per event, use a Fusion Point to increase the tier to bypass encryption (see below) by 1.  This increase may be countered by knowledge of how the runes work (the creator innately ignores it) or extracting the information from the creator.",,"A Schematic (see The Object’s Schematics below) that hides the description, tier, and other information behind a card or other device that is labeled with the Artificer Tier necessary to decrypt.",,1,,,Per Event,,
Cooperative Action [Artificer],"The best Artificers learn that they can get further by working together.

Artorias’ Silver Weapon,"[Weaponry, Alchemy] Through careful art, science, and ritual, you are able to silver-plate to your weapon’s blade like Sir Artorias the Moonslayer.

Bypass Encryption 1,"[Runes].

Artificer’s Wayfinder,"[Wondrous Items, Clothing].

Alchemical Concoction 1,"[Alchemy, Armor, Clothing]. You tinker with your headgear, experimenting with protective oils, salves, and bulwarks that bolster your safety– at least at first blush.  Once per event, you may spend two minutes applying a concoction to headgear.  This headgear confers a one-time additional floating hit.

Alchemist’s Fire,"[Alchemy, Weaponry]. Through curious alchemical tinkering, you’ve bottled congealed fire.  Expend one Fusion Point.  You gain one vial of alchemist fire.  You can hurl it or use it to make your weapon wreath itself in flame.   Hurling alchemist fire deals 1 Fire Damage upon impact, which bypasses shields (but not armor).",Artificer,2,,"Having Appraise [Weapon] enables an additional option: if applied to a weapon, your melee weapon or consumable artillery now deals Fire damage for one encounter, causing grievous wounds to creatures like Trolls and Scarecrows.  It also sheds light as though it is a torch.",Only a character with the Alchemist’s Fire Skill may safely use Alchemist’s Fire (projectile or weapon) without instantly going up in flames themselves.,"Thrown alchemist fire should mirror a LARP-safe fireball or nerf-football.  Applying alchemist fire to a weapon should be represented by a red ribbon.

Elemental Quiver 1,"[Runes, Wondrous Items].  Experimenting with binding runes, you stitch a favored elemental energy into a worn quiver, sack, or bolt bag. Select a single element when you take this Skill: fire, ice, or lightning.  Once per event, for one encounter, you may change the damage type of all projectiles within the container to that element.  Your damage is the same, but with this damage type overwriting any other damage type (e.g., poison, magic, holy) by stating, “Power of the [Object]: [Element].”",Artificer,2,"Expend a Medium Gem, a Fusion Point, and consult the Schematic that matches your chosen element (Fireball, Lightning Bolt, or Ice Storm) to empower your Quiver.  Your projectiles gain additional effects matching your Quiver’s element.
Elemental Quiver (Fire) projectiles bypass armor and shields but always deal 1 hit worth of fire damage.
Elemental Quiver (Lightning) arrows destroy shields and metal armor (“ARMOR BROKEN”), but no damage passes through.  Unarmored or non-metal armor is normal damage but lightning typed.
Elemental Quiver (Ice) destroys shields (“SHIELD BROKEN”).  All projectiles deal 0 damage. If the projectile hits a non-shield, the target is under the effects of the Healer’s Hold Person spell for 15 seconds, frozen on the spot, but gaining the Mage spell Protection from Fire (“FREEZE FOR 15, PROTECTION FROM FIRE”).  The freeze can end early under two conditions: first, If Protection from Fire’s benefit is triggered by another effect (e.g., the frozen target is hit by Alchemist Fire), it negates the fire damage, and the target is freed.  Likewise, if the target takes non-fire damage, the ice shatters (“FREED!”).","This typing is for the projectile.  Damage may increase when fired from Relics or weapons empowered for damage (e.g., Relics, Blessed weapons).","You may take this Skill only once, choosing a single element for your Quiver and Schematic.  You may not change to another element later, even if you find other Schematics.  This item counts toward the limit of equipped Artificer Objects a character may attune to at once. Projectiles may only be used by the wearer of the quiver, and they lose their element after striking a target or hitting the ground, until re-seated in the Quiver. Spells like Protection from Fire and Protection from Ice and Cold may negate projectile effects. The Rogue’s Quick Feet Skill negates all effects when active.  Lastly, if a character cannot hear your effect from across the field, it does not manifest.","The Warrior or Rogue Archery skill, as well as a check-in with an experienced archer trainer.

You forge a helper-automaton to aid you in your Artificer tasks through a ritual with an audience.  At the end of the ritual, expend a Fusion Point.  When a homunculus is on your person and engaged in a scene, you may reduce your character’s time to attune to an Artificer Object by 1 minute (minimum 1 minute).  Once ‘built,’ the homunculus persists indefinitely and does not apply to the limit of Artificer items created in future events.",Artificer,3, You may expend a Tiny gem and a Fusion Point to increase the reduction to 2 minutes (minimum 1 minute) for 4 hours.  You may expend a Small Gem and a Fusion to reduce it by 2 minutes (minimum 1 minute) AND grant your Homunculus the use of [Cooperative Action] for purposes of encrypting or decrypting Schematics for 4 hours.  ,,"A plush doll, stuffed animal, figurine, 3d printed creature, or something else along those lines—tailored to look like a clockwork or created creature.  This should be plainly visible in any scene in which it is used and LARP-safe.

Sapper Constructs,"The player already capable of impromptu repair is now trained in the art of combat engineering, having shown an aptitude to repair and build under combat conditions, the player amasses a kit of tools that allows them to half the time of repairs and gives them the ability to create simple offensive and defensive structures in the field. Structures appear as quickly as they can be brought to the field and may include the following:

Barricades: The player can construct up to 2 barricades + 1 for every Tier passed 6. Barricades may be up to 5’ feet wide and up to 2’ feet deep. They act as shields in reference to being destroyed and have 2 structural damage points at Tier 6, and +1 structural damage point for each Tier after.  

Trench: The trench is a 5x10 foot area that players passing through must go on their knees. 

Watchpost: The Player can construct up to 2 at a time watch posts that a single player can stand on. The watchpost is a single “fenced in” 5x5 block raised from the ground no more than 3 feet with only a single “entrance point”, the location of which is denoted by a lack of fence on the 5x5 block. Players on the watchpost cannot be engaged in melee combat unless from this entrance point. If a player falls from the watchpost by going off a point that is not the entryway or if the watchpost is destroyed, they are rendered unconscious. Watchposts act as shields in reference to being destroyed.

Battering Ram: The warrior may create a battering ram that can destroy normal doors and gates. A battering ram will do 1 structural point of damage per person operating it. ",Warrior,5,,,,"Barricades may be improvised with a pile of relatively safe brush or debris scavenged from surroundings, or prefabricated and put in place, alternatively the area may be marked with a rope, it must have a note attached that clearly marks it as a BARRICADE, and its structural points along with the makers mark and Tier.

Trench: Represented with an outline of field paint, foam, or black fabric.

Watchtower: A maximum of a 5x5 area roped off as a structure, with at least one clearly marked entrance.
